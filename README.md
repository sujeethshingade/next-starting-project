# Next.js Starting Project

## Installation

```npm install```
```npm run dev```

### Creating Routes in Next.js

1. In the app directory create a folder (name the folder the router destination) and create page.js file in it
2. It is the combination of the folder name and page.js file that creates a new route in next.js
3. In that file you can export a standard react component function which is same in next.js, where the name of the component doesn't matter
4. Now you can view the contents in its path ( /path-name ) or <http://localhost:3000/awesome> (as the folder name is awesome)
